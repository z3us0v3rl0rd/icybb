# Thanks for checking out IceBB
Hi there and I just wanted to thank you for checking out my project IceBB. IceBB is a personal project on mine to write forum softare that's based on a codebase that I understand and don't have to think about when writing new features and such. Maybe it'll get big maybe it won't. Regardless it's a fun project.

## Current Timeline
* I'm working on the account system this weekend and I hope to get login and registration complete.
* Basic things will take longer since all HTML utilizes the language file system. It's annoying right now but remember that it'll make things like translation projects and such a lot easier in the long run.
* 

## A quick note on the name IceBB
This software shouldn't be confused with the IceBB Project from 2014 (https://github.com/icebb/IceBB) that I haven't seen any updates on it and I am assuming that the project was abandoned. For now I'm sticking with the name however if the author contacts me I'll be more than happy to  do a name change.
