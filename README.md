# Thanks for checking out IcyBB
Hi there and I just wanted to thank you for checking out my project IcyBB. IcyBB is a personal project on mine to write forum softare that's based on a codebase that I understand and don't have to think about when writing new features and such. Maybe it'll get big maybe it won't. Regardless it's a fun project.

## Current Timeline
* I'm working on the account system this weekend and I hope to get login and registration complete.
* Basic things will take longer since all HTML utilizes the language file system. It's annoying right now but remember that it'll make things like translation projects and such a lot easier in the long run.
* 

## Name changed (IceBB to IcyBB)
To avoid any confusion I changed the name from IceBB to IcyBB after realizing an IceBB project already existed. I was going to just keep the name but I changed my mind after I decided to make a Github Organization to house the project.
